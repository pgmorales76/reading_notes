## Explain “growth mindset” in your own words:
### **Developers are _developed_, not _born_!**


## Include reminders to yourself of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset:
### - When a challenge seems to disrupt your momentum, don’t stop, suddenly. Try to keep some, any, momentum. Even if it means moving at a snails pace.
### ⁃	Embrace decomposition: 

> “Bob: Baby steps?
>  Dr. Marvin: It means setting small, reasonable, goals, one step at a time. One tiny, little, step at a time.
   For instance, when you leave this office, don’t think about everything you must do I. Order to get of the building,
   think of what you must do I. Order to get out of this room. And, when you get    the hall, deal with that hall, and
   so forth. You see?” - What About Bob? 

###   Break the problem down into smaller iterations, so the scale of the problem isn’t too daunting.
### ⁃	Failure and criticism are not to be avoided like the plague (the pandemic?), but embraced as learning and GROWTH opportunities.
### ⁃	Surround yourself with people whose skills are superior to yours which will be viewed as inspirational and objectives to be achieved.
