## How Computers Work

### What makes a computer, a computer?

#### - Machines can help us with physical work, but can they help us with mental work?

#### - In order for a machine to "think", it needs to perform four functions: input, storage, processing, output. These functions are common to all computers!

### Binary & Data

#### - Computers work on "0's" and "1's" (Binary)

#### - Each "0" and "1" represent a "bit", the smallest amount of data a computer can input, store, process, and output

### Circuits and Logic

#### - Circuits are components in a computer that takes input, performs a function, and outputs information

#### - Because computers work with a binary number system, logic (AND, OR, etc.) is applied to perform certain functions

### CPU, Memory, Input, & Output

#### Input & Output: Mouse, keyboard, camera, microphone, screen, speaker, printer are examples of input and output devices

#### - CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the "brain" of the computer, where the main calculations are done

### Hardware and Software

#### - Hardware are the physical components of the computer

#### - Software is code within the physical components of the computer
