## Wireframe and Design

### What is a wireframe?

#### - Wireframing is a practice used by designers which allow them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product

#### - Wireframing is also a great way of getting to know how a user interacts with your interface, through the positioning of buttons and menus on the diagrams

#### - A commonly-used argument for wireframing is that if a user doesn’t know where to go on a plain hand-drawn diagram of your site page, then it is irrelevant what colors or fancy text eventually get used

### Wireframe Examples

#### - Wireframes drawn with paper and pencil have the advantage of being very easy to change

#### - Switching later to software allows you to keep track of more detailed decisions

### Things to consider before you start wireframing

#### - The decision to use online tools, or to wireframe by hand, and the process used to get to from wireframe to code, is related to what approach the particular situation requires

### Six steps to make a wireframe

#### 1. Do your research

#### 2. Prepare your research for quick reference

#### 3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out

#### 4. Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate

#### 5. Add some detail and get testing

#### 6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes

### How to make your wireframe good

#### - Clarity

#### - Confidence

#### - Simplicity is key

## Mozilla HTML Basics

### So, what is HTML?

#### - HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a *markup language* that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way

### Anatomy of an HTML element

#### Below is the anatomy of a paragraph element

#### Elements can also have attributes that look like the following

### Anatomy of an HTML document

`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" />
  </body>
</html>
`

### Images

#### The image element embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this via the src (source) attribute, which contains the path to our image file. Also included is an alt (alternative) attribute. In the alt attribute, you specify descriptive text for users who cannot see the image

`<img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" />`
