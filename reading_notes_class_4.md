## Wireframe and Design

### What is a wireframe?

#### - Wireframing is a practice used by designers which allow them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product

#### - Wireframing is also a great way of getting to know how a user interacts with your interface, through the positioning of buttons and menus on the diagrams

#### - A commonly-used argument for wireframing is that if a user doesn’t know where to go on a plain hand-drawn diagram of your site page, then it is irrelevant what colors or fancy text eventually get used

### Wireframe Examples

#### - Wireframes drawn with paper and pencil have the advantage of being very easy to change

#### - Switching later to software allows you to keep track of more detailed decisions
