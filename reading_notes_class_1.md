# Creating a webpage using Markdown!

## For our first day of class, we're going to be using a markup language called "Markdown"!

### Markdown is a markup language, but it's different than HTML.

#### - Markdown is different than a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) editor such as Microsoft Word or Google Docs.

#### - For the purposes of introducing us to simple webpage creation, we're starting with Markdown, rather than HTML.

#### - When I started looking at the syntax used, it reminded me of the syntax used for creating, editing, a Wikipedia page.

### Markdown Syntax

#### - In the same way there are six section heading levels in HTML, there are six section heading leves in Markdown. Using the "#" symbol, you can create a heading. The highest heading level uses one "#" symbol. The lowest uses six "#" symbols.

#### = To create a blockquote, place a greater than symbol (>) in front of a paragraph.

#### - You can create ordered and unordered lists in Markdown, just like HTML. For ordered lists, place a number in front of the list item. For unordered lists, add dashes in front of list items.

#### - To create a link, the text you'd like the link to display goes inside brackets "[]". The URL goes inside parentheses "()".
       - [alt link text](URL)

#### - To add an image, type an exclamation point, followed by alt text in brackets, and the path/URL to the image in parentheses.
       - ![The San Juan Mountains are beautiful!](/assets/images/san-juan-mountains.jpg)

#### - The basic syntax guide can be found at [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

## Explain “growth mindset” in your own words:
### **Developers are _developed_, not _born_!**


## Include reminders to yourself of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset:
### - When a challenge seems to disrupt your momentum, don’t stop, suddenly. Try to keep some, any, momentum. Even if it means moving at a snails pace.
### ⁃	Embrace decomposition: Break the problem down into smaller iterations, so the scale of the problem isn’t too daunting.

> Bob: Baby Steps?
> 
> Dr. Marvin: It means setting small, reasonable, goals for yourself. One day at a time. One tiny step at a time.
>
> Bob: Baby Steps!
> 
> Dr. Marvin: For instance, when you leave this office, don’t think about everything you have to do in order to get of the building, just think of what you must do to get out of this room. And, when you get the hall, deal with that hall, and so forth. You see?

### ⁃	Failure and criticism are not to be avoided like the plague (the pandemic?), but embraced as learning and GROWTH opportunities.
### ⁃	Surround yourself with people whose skills are superior to yours which will be viewed as inspirational and objectives to be achieved.
