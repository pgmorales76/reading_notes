# Class 6 Reading Notes

## 3 Major parts of what is referred to as "Javascript"

### 1. The language itself

### 2. The DOM API

### 3. The server API (or just API)

### Editor or IDE?

#### - Any text editor can be used

### Embed or include?

#### - You can either embed the JavaScript code directly inside the HTML file, or you can put a line in the HTML file that will include the external JavaScript file

#### - In order to do that we add the `<script>` opening and `</script>` closing tags. Between the two we write our JavaScript code
