# Class 6 Reading Notes

## 3 Major parts of what is referred to as "Javascript"

### 1. The language itself

### 2. The DOM API

### 3. The server API (or just API)

### Editor or IDE?

#### - Any text editor can be used

### Embed or include?

#### - You can either embed the JavaScript code directly inside the HTML file, or you can put a line in the HTML file that will include the external JavaScript file

#### - In order to do that we add the `<script>` opening and `</script>` closing tags. Between the two we write our JavaScript code

### Input/Output

#### - The very first thing we need to learn is how to interact with the JavaScript code running in the browse. There are a number of way JavaScript can display text for the user (output). The most simple one is by using the alert function

### alert

#### - This will show a pop-up in the browser with the text. The `alert()` function is rarely used, but it is an easy way to show the use of JavaScript

    <script language="javascript">
 
    alert("Hello World");
 
    </script>

### document.write

    <script>
 
    document.write("<h1>Hello World</h1>");
 
    </script>

#### - The JavaScript code uses the `document.write` function to change the content of the page. It will embed the html snippet `<h1>`Hello World`</h1>`

### console.log

    <script>
 
    console.log("Hello World");
 
    </script>

#### - Most of the web browsers provide what is called a "JavaScript console". It is an additional window which is normally not visible, where the browser can print out warnings and errors generated by the execution of the JavaScript code. The developer can also print information to this console using the `console.log()` call

## JS input with prompt and confirm

### prompt

#### - The fist one is called `prompt`. It will show a pop-up window with the text provided as the first parameter and with a textbox the user can fill in. When the user presses `OK`, the value in the text box will be returned by the `prompt()` function. Then, in this example we use the `document.write` method to update the html with the text

    <script>
 
    var name = prompt("Your name:", "");
    document.write("Hello ", name);
 
    </script>

#### - The textbox will be pre-filled with the content of the second parameter. This can be very useful if we would like to ask the user to edit some value. We can pre-fill the box with the old value

    <script>
 
    var name = prompt("Please correct your e-mail address:", "foo@bar.co");
    document.write("Your e-mail address is ", name);
 
    </script>

#### - In either case, if the user presses `cancel` or hits the `ESC` the `prompt()` function will return `null`

### confirm

#### - The other pop-up is not really an input method. It allows the developer to ask a Yes/No question. Calling the `confirm()` function will show a pop-up window with the provided texts and with two buttons. If the user presses `OK` the `confirm()` function will return `true`, if the user presses `cancel` or hits the `ESC` key, the function will return `false`

#### - That code can basically be translated to the following English sentence

`If the user presses OK when we asked "Shall I print Hello World?", then print "Hello World", otherwise print "OK, I won't print it."`

    <script>
 
    if (confirm("Shall I print Hello World?")) {
        document.write("Hello World");
        } else {
            document.write("OK, I won't print it.");
        }
 
    </script>

## Javascript Variables

### We are going to use two ways to declare a JS variable: `let` and `const`

### What are variables?

#### - Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values)

#### - In this example, x and y are variables, declared with the `let` or `const` keyword

    let x = 5
    const y = 5

### When to use `let` keyword?

#### - If you think the value of the variable can change, use `let`

### When to use `const` keyword?

#### - If you think the value of the variable won't change (actually, it can't be changed!), use `const`

### JS Identifiers

#### - All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names

#### - These unique names are called identifiers

#### - Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume)

#### The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are

#### - Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs

#### - Names must begin with a letter

#### - Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)

#### - Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)

#### - Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

### The Assignment Operator

#### In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator

#### This is different from algebra. The following does not make sense in algebra

    x = x + 5

#### In JavaScript, however, it makes perfect sense: it assigns the value of x + 5 to x

#### (It calculates the value of x + 5 and puts the result into x. The value of x is incremented by 5.)

### JS Data Types

#### - JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe"

#### - In programming, text values are called text strings

#### - JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings

#### - Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes

#### - If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string
