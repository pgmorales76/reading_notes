# Class 6 Reading Notes

## 3 Major parts of what is referred to as "Javascript"

### 1. The language itself

### 2. The DOM API

### 3. The server API (or just API)

### Editor or IDE?

#### - Any text editor can be used

### Embed or include?

#### - You can either embed the JavaScript code directly inside the HTML file, or you can put a line in the HTML file that will include the external JavaScript file

#### - In order to do that we add the `<script>` opening and `</script>` closing tags. Between the two we write our JavaScript code

### Input/Output

#### - The very first thing we need to learn is how to interact with the JavaScript code running in the browse. There are a number of way JavaScript can display text for the user (output). The most simple one is by using the alert function

### alert

#### - This will show a pop-up in the browser with the text. The `alert()` function is rarely used, but it is an easy way to show the use of JavaScript

    <script language="javascript">
 
    alert("Hello World");
 
    </script>

### document.write

    <script>
 
    document.write("<h1>Hello World</h1>");
 
    </script>

#### - The JavaScript code uses the `document.write` function to change the content of the page. It will embed the html snippet `<h1>`Hello World`</h1>`

### console.log

    <script>
 
    console.log("Hello World");
 
    </script>

#### - Most of the web browsers provide what is called a "JavaScript console". It is an additional window which is normally not visible, where the browser can print out warnings and errors generated by the execution of the JavaScript code. The developer can also print information to this console using the `console.log()` call
