# Practice with Git

## Review Your Past Reading-Notes Entries

### After watching the lecture for Class 3, I began to encounter problems with the Terminal app for macOS. It appeared that Git wasn't tracking my repo directory as it should. I think what the problem ended up being was I didn't setup my computer properly the day before in the computer lab (Coder's computer). I followed the instructions, explicitly, so I'm operating on the assumption that it was the fault of Code Fellows (JUST KIDDING!!!)

### Professor Kassie helped me with the issues and everything turned out fine. I mean, the experienced ruined my Sunday, and I was left helpless, but I'm not looking for sympathy. So, don't give me any (but, if you'd like to, my phone number is 201-KL5 . . . )

### I proofreed the entries as I follow the course, so if I did edit the pages, it was little things, such as adding a link to the homepage for every individual page, editing the pages so they would all have the same structure and similar look, etc

### Perhaps a larger scale edit, integrating the material being taught, was I figured out how to make a directory in the local repo for images, download pictures to it from the Git tuttorial, and use them in the webpage for the class 3 reading notes with VS Code. I must say, I did have pride in myself for adding that to the webpage, even though that wasn't a requirement

## Build out your site structure

### The first, major, edit for the reading_notes repo was the introduction of a Table of Contents. This wasn't terribly difficult because it's just a series of links to the other pages for each day of the class (this is what lead me to creating a home link for every page)

### Since the computer was ready-to-go, I started using VS Code to edit the webpages and track the edits with Git

## Keep a clean Git history

### The first bit of trouble I ran into was not remembering, once you clone the repo down to your local machine, you shouldn't be using Github on the browser, anymore. This can cause all kinds of "gituations" (Thanks, Prof. Kassie!)

### Compared to the problem I was having earlier, this was a simple fix

### Essentially, to bring back your local machine and the remote machine to the same page, you do a pull command. This is similar to cloning, but you're resolving disputes between both machines. I just followed what Prof. Kassie did in the lecture, and it was fixed

### After this, I created my reading notes for class 3, and I was done

### I think I learned 2 important skills with this class, namely, troubleshooting and muscle memory

### Because of what I learned in the lecture, I was able to apply it in a situation where help was needed. I also learned that I didn't need a TA every time I ran into trouble and was able to build some confidence in my own abilities to figure problems out. Even if you don't know the answer right away, having that confidence and grace under pressure enables you to think clearly and have a better chance of solving problems on your own. This is part of the Journey! [ANYWAY YOU WANT IT!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YTizJcKUlE)

### The other aspect of the learning exercise was memorizing the steps for A-C-P (adding, committing, and pushing). While these steps aren't very difficult, sometimes the sheer volume of the learning material can be overwhelming. Because of this, you can miss a step, do the steps out of order, or make some other kind of mistake that interrupts the entire workflow. Activities like these, create those good habits that'll serve you in the long term

### Thanks, Prof. Kassie!
