# Class 2 Reading Notes

## Read: 02 - The Coder's Computer

### Document in your reading-notes the different classifications of text editors.

#### - A text editor edits and manages text, and manages files.

#### - An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is everything a text editor is, but it can include a compiler and a debugger, as well. 

### Why it's important for software developers to be thoughtful about their selection of what they use to write code.

#### - Using the software that comes installed on your computer to edit text can be useful, if your coding needs are very simple.

#### - The more advanced your coding needs become, the more advanced your development tools need to be. This is where third-party options become handy!

#### - While an IDE may be beyond your development needs in the beginning, I think it's a good idea to use it as soon as you can in your development journey.

#### - Get an idea of what your development needs are as soon as you can, so you can figure out the tools you'll need to get the job done, correctly!

#### - A relative path is a file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.
#### - An absolute path is a file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.
#### - There's a difference between the relative path . . . and the absolute path (Thanks, Morpheus!)
